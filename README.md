# JS/TS practice tasks

This is a monorepo. All tasks are located in the `tasks` directory. Each task contains a README.md with a description and instructions.

Ensure you have **Node.js** installed. Then, clone the repository and install dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/wjatek/practice-tasks.git
cd practice-tasks
npm i
```

To check the result run `test` script in the task directory:

```sh
cd tasks/my-current-task
npm test
```

To submit the result create a new branch, commit your changes, push the branch and create PR on GitHub:

```sh
git checkout -b name-of-the-branch
git add .
git commit -m 'commit message'
git push
// use generated link
```
